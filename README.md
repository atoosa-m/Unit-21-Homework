### Background

Let's assume as a fintech professional I am chosen to lead a project developing a monetary system for the first human colony on Mars; and I've decided to base this new system on blockchain technology and to define a new cryptocurrency named **KaseiCoin**. (Kasei means Mars in Japanese.) My KaseiCoin will be a fungible token thatâ€™s ERC-20 compliant. I am going to launch a crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.   
Let's get to work!

### Step 1: Create the KaseiCoin Token Contract  
  
### Step 2: Create the KaseiCoin Crowdsale Contract  

### Step 3: Create the KaseiCoin Deployer Contract  

### Step 4: Deploy and Test the Crowdsale on a Local Blockchain
